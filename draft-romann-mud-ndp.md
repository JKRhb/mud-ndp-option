--- abstract

The document specifies a new IPv6 Router Solicitation option
for emitting Manufacturer Usage Descriptions (MUDs, RFC 8520) URLs.
This simplifies the integration of MUD into environments that primarily use
IPv6.

# Introduction

Note: Everything here is still WIP.

Manufacturer Usage Descriptions (MUDs) {{!RFC8520}} can be used to describe
the kind of network access a device needs in order to properly function.
This information can be used to reduce the attack surface of a network, e.g.
by applying a corresponding firewall configuration that prohibits all traffic.
MUD nodes are supposed to indicate which MUD file describes them by emitting
a URL that is processed by a so-called MUD manager.

Nodes that operate in the Internet of Things (IoT) primarily rely on IPv6 due
to the scarcity of IPv4 addresses vis-Ã -vis a rapidly growing number of devices
and the use of IPv6 in constrained environments via protocols such as 6LoWPAN.
Although {{!RFC8520}} specifies a DHCPv6 {{?RFC8415}} option that can be used by
IPv6 devices for emitting their MUD URL, IPv6 addresses are most commonly not
assigned via DHCPv6, but via Stateless Address Autoconfiguration (SLAAC)
{{?RFC4862}} using the Neighbor Discovery Protocol (NDP) {{!RFC4861}}.
This renders many IoT devices incapable of using a standardized way for
emitting MUD URLs if they are not employing an out-of-band solution such as the
emission via a QR code {{?RFC9238}}.
<!-- TODO: Also mention LLDP and X.509 certificates -->

To potentially close this gap, this document proposes a new NDP option which
can be used in Router Solicitation (RS) messages.
This enables IPv6 nodes to emit their MUD URLs more easily when using SLAAC.

# Conventions and Definitions

{::boilerplate bcp14-tagged}

This document makes use of the terms defined in {{!RFC8520}}]. The
   following additional terms are used: TBD

# Node Behavior

Nodes that are described by a MUD file MAY use the NDP option specified in
{{option-format}} for emitting a MUD URL in Router Solicitations.
Corresponding with {{Section 10.1 of RFC8520}}, this option MUST NOT be
repeated.
Furthermore, if the node also uses DHCPv4 or DHCPv6 to emit its MUD URL,
the MUD URL options MUST contain the same value.

# Router Behavior

A router that receives an RS containing a MUD URL option MAY ignore it or
forward its extracted value to interested entities, such as an external MUD
manager.
Routers SHOULD inform these entities about any changes to a node's state and
their address configuration.

# Option Format {#option-format}

{{fig-ndp-mud}} specifies the layout of the MUD NDP Option.
The option MUST only be used in Router Solicitation messages and follows the
format defined for DHCP and DHCPv6 in {{!RFC8520}}.

# Security Considerations

In general, the security considerations from {{!RFC8520}} also apply to this
document.

Since NDP is not a secure protocol, MUD URLs can get compromised if an
attacker performs a man-in-the-middle attack.
To minimize this risk, SEcure Neighbor Discovery (SEND) {{!RF3971}} SHOULD be
used in order to assert the integrity of the emitted MUD URLs.

TODO: Add more security considerations


# IANA Considerations

IANA is requested to assign the following new IPv6 Neighbor Discovery Option
type in the "IPv6 Neighbor Discovery Option Formats" sub-registry under the
"Internet Control Message Protocol version 6 (ICMPv6) Parameters" registry.
