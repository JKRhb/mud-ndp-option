--- abstract

The document specifies a new IPv6 Router Solicitation option
for emitting Manufacturer Usage Descriptions (MUDs, RFC 8520) URLs.
This simplifies the integration of MUD into environments that primarily use
IPv6.

# Introduction

Note: Everything here is still WIP.

Manufacturer Usage Descriptions (MUDs) {{!RFC8520}} can be used to describe
the kind of network access a device needs in order to properly function.
This information can be used to reduce the attack surface of a network, e.g.
by applying a corresponding firewall configuration that prohibits all traffic.
MUD nodes are supposed to indicate which MUD file describes them by emitting
a URL that is processed by a so-called MUD manager.

Devices that operate in Internet of Things (IoT) primarily rely on IPv6 due to
the scarcity of IPv4 addresses vis-Ã -vis a rapidly growing number of devices
and the use of IPv6 in constrained environments via protocols such as 6LoWPAN.
Although {{!RFC8520}} specifies a DHCPv6 {{?RFC8415}} option that can be used by
IPv6 devices for emitting their MUD URL, IPv6 addresses are most commonly
assigned via Stateless Address Autoconfiguration (SLAAC) {{?RFC4862}} using the
Neighbor Discovery Protocol (NDP) {{!RFC4861}} and not via DHCPv6.
This renders many IoT devices uncapable of using a standardized way for
emitting MUD URLs if they are not employing an out-of-band solution such as the
emission via a QR code {{?RFC9238}}.
<!-- TODO: Also mention LLDP and X.509 certificates -->

To potentially close this gap, this document proposes a new NDP option which
can be used in Router Solicitation (RS) messages.
This enables IPv6 nodes to emit their MUD URLs more easily when using SLAAC.
