Router Solicitation Option for Manufacturer Usage Description (MUD) URLs
                      draft-romann-mud-ndp-latest

Abstract

   The document specifies a new IPv6 Router Solicitation option for
   emitting Manufacturer Usage Descriptions (MUDs, RFC 8520) URLs.  This
   simplifies the integration of MUD into environments that primarily
   use IPv6.

1.  Introduction

   Note: Everything here is still WIP.

   Manufacturer Usage Descriptions (MUDs) [RFC8520] can be used to
   describe the kind of network access a device needs in order to
   properly function.  This information can be used to reduce the attack
   surface of a network, e.g. by applying a corresponding firewall
   configuration that prohibits all traffic.  MUD nodes are supposed to
   indicate which MUD file describes them by emitting a URL that is
   processed by a so-called MUD manager.

   Nodes that operate in the Internet of Things (IoT) primarily rely on
   IPv6 due to the scarcity of IPv4 addresses vis-a-vis a rapidly
   growing number of devices and the use of IPv6 in constrained
   environments via protocols such as 6LoWPAN.  Although [RFC8520]
   specifies a DHCPv6 [RFC8415] option that can be used by IPv6 devices
   for emitting their MUD URL, IPv6 addresses are most commonly not
   assigned via DHCPv6, but via Stateless Address Autoconfiguration
   (SLAAC) [RFC4862] using the Neighbor Discovery Protocol (NDP)
   [RFC4861].  This renders many IoT devices incapable of using a
   standardized way for emitting MUD URLs if they are not employing an
   out-of-band solution such as the emission via a QR code [RFC9238].

   To potentially close this gap, this document proposes a new NDP
   option which can be used in Router Solicitation (RS) messages.  This
   enables IPv6 nodes to emit their MUD URLs more easily when using
   SLAAC.

2.  Conventions and Definitions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   BCP 14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

   This document makes use of the terms defined in [RFC8520]].  The
   following additional terms are used: TBD

5.  IANA Considerations

   IANA is requested to assign the following new IPv6 Neighbor Discovery
   Option type in the "IPv6 Neighbor Discovery Option Formats" sub-
   registry under the "Internet Control Message Protocol version 6
   (ICMPv6) Parameters" registry.
